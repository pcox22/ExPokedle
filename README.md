# ExPokedle
ExPokedle is short for "Expanded Pokémon Puzzle" or "Expanded Pokémon Idle." The goal is to create a robust website featuring daily puzzles in which participants must guess today's Pokémon based on how the statistics of their guesses compares to that of the actual answer.

## Tech-Stack
The makeup of the website is still to be determined. The guaranteed aspects are that it will be a psuedo-Full-Stack application. Currently, plans are to implement Angular as the primary frontend framework, and communicate directly with a PostgreSQL database (Supabase). This may change depending on the required security or scalability for ExPokedle. Since a lot of elements are unfamiliar, development is expected to move slowly at first.

## Disclaimer
While the names or features of various intellectual properties may appear in this project, I do not own any of them. All Pokémon are owned directly by the Pokémon Company and Nintendo. If this site is found to be in violation of their wishes, I will comply and directly remove it. Granted, ExPokedle is currently just theoretical, and there is no guarantee that its quality will reach a level that warrants deployment and hosting. If that day comes, a private copy of this repository will be created for security's sake, and any adjustments required will be made to this one.
